                Naruto is an anime series aired by Tv Tokyo in Japan. The plot takes place in "Konoha" or village hidden in the leaves. Twelve years prior the village was being devasted by the Kyuubi or nine-tailed fox who was on a rampage. In order to protect the village, the 4th Hokage sealed the beast in the new born child Naruto. Growing up Naruto was all alone since his parents were killed by the Kyuubi, and the villagers avoided and outcasted him because they feared the beast inside him. Naruto's dream is to become Hokage, the strongest ninja, in order to win the respect and acknoledgement from his fellow villagers. He meets many friends and foes along the way.

            Naruto is a great series with an action-packed, exciting, and even touching plot. Unfortunately, Tv Tokyo added 93 filler episodes that have nothing to do with the original story line written by Masashi Kishimoto. Because of this, many people give Naruto a harsh review which is not fair to Kishimoto's work. 
            <br>
            Real Naruto's goal is give users a better understanding of Naruto by introducing some main characters, as well as a better watching experience by excluding all filler episodes. Also, have some fun with some of the popular quotes from the anime!
